# RP2040 Stamp Footprints and Symbols

This repo contains symbols and footprints for the RP2040 Stamp for various CAD programs.

The "KiCad" directory can be used with KiCad v6, for v5 version, see the "KiCad5" directory.

If you notice any issues with the footprints (we are mainly KiCad users), or want to port the footprint to a new program, PRs are very welcome :)
